## Installation

See [installation instructions](docs/install.md).

## Introduction

Our method contains the following four steps.
1. Learn a oracle policy with privileged information and point-clouds with RL in simulation.
2. Learn a padapt-based student policy using the oracle policy in simulation.
3. Using the trained rotation policy as motion prior, we leverage teleoperation to collect trajectories with downward motion and tactile sensing in real world.
4. Train a behavior cloning policy with expert trajectories to fuse extra observations.

The following session only provides example script of our method. For baselines, checkout [baselines](docs/baseline.md).

## Step 1: Oracle Policy Training

To train an oracle policy $f$ with RL, run

```
# 0 is GPU is
# 42 is experiment seed
scripts/screwdriver_teacher.sh 0 42 output_name
```

After training your oracle policy, you can visualize it as follows:
```
scripts/vis_screwdriver_teacher.sh 0 42 ckpt_name
```

## Step 2: Sensorimotor policy Training

In this section, we train a sensorimotor policy by distilling from our trained oracle policy $f$.

Note we use the proprioceptive adapt to train the sensorimotor policy.

```
scripts/screwdriver_student_padapt.sh 0 42 output_name
```

## Step 3: Rotational Policy deployment in Real Hardware

To generate the rotational policy from the student policy $\pi$, run
```
scripts/convert_student_jit.sh
```

To deploy rotational policy on real hardware, please refer to `./xhand-deploy`.

## Step 4: Real-world Fine-tuning
